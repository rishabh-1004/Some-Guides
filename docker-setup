The next step is to add the Docker repository. From the terminal window, create the new file with the command sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list and add the following contents:

deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main

Install the dependencies
Before we install Docker, there are a couple of dependencies that must be taken care ofâ€”these can all be handled with a single command. Go back to your terminal window and issue the following:

sudo apt-get install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual
You're ready to install Docker.

Installing, starting, and testing Docker
Docker can now be installed with a single command. From the terminal, issue the following:

sudo apt-get install docker-engine

When the installation completes, you'll want to add your user to the Docker group with the command:

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

Once your user has been added, you can run the docker command as your standard user.

In order to run a Docker command, you must first fire up Docker with the command sudo service docker start. You can now test to make sure Docker is installed and running properly by downloading the hello-world test image. From the terminal window, issue the command docker run hello-world.
